	<p>Sharkepedia is a website detailing all of the things sharks can do, without actually researching anything about sharks! Located within the pages of this website, you will learn things about sharks that you never thought possible.</br> Probably because they aren't.</p>
	<p>Enough about the site, you came here to learn about sharks and I'm not going to disappoint on that front, so pick a shark and start your education!<p>
