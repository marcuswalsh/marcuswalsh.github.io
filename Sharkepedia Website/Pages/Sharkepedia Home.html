	<p>Sharkepedia is a website detailing all of the things sharks can do, without actually researching anything about sharks! If you have to write an essay on sharks, then you can do all of your research here to be sure that you get 100%. If you're a marine biologist but don't know anything about sharks, come to this site to get all those shark facts so that you can pretend you know what you're talking about!</p>
